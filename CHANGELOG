Known issues:
============
* C# plugins may not work if RegisterClass is hooked because CoInitialize(Ex) calls RegisterClass on STA and, at this
  point, COM initialization in not complete yet.
* Plugins may not work in IE8 unless executed with elevated privileges because of COM security model used by the app.
